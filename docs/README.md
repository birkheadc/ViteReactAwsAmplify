# Vite React Aws Amplify

A template for projects I refer to. Developed with Vite, using React, and Designed to be deployed to Aws Amplify.

## Environment Variables

Locally, environment variables are read from .env in the root directory. This file is not checked into git so it must be created. For a list of what variables are needed for the app to function, see `src/vite-env.d.ts`. This file acts as a list of necessary environment variables, as well as provides type support for them.
