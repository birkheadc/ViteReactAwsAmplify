# TODO

- Set up branches on Amplify -- right now every branch points to Development branch of backend
- Create a more dynamic method of mocking api for storybook

- Add a toast when unable to fetch books

  - Maybe color the error box beneath the table as well

- useRefreshToast fails to launch a toast at all if it tries to launch a toast just as the previous toast is expiring
  - Maybe a problem with the package...

- Update npm packages

- Create some kind of system for forcing a user to update their data when it is incomplete (display name must be chosen, etc)

  - Modal or reroute to profile page form? Hmm...

- Fix table columns misalignment, right align numbers

- In development, get a 404 for some reason on first page load...
